This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The problem arises because Tailwind's JIT mode generates CSS classes based on the components used in your application during build time. If a component used on a client-side route is not rendered on the server, the corresponding Tailwind classes may not be included in the generated CSS, resulting in missing styles. This often leads to unexpected visual errors only appearing in client-side navigation or after page hydration.
